# Hemisphere #

Hemisphere is a mobile game build in Unity3D as my first Unity project.

### Game description ###

Train both brain hemispheres with the game Hemisphere.

The left side of the brain is focused on logical tasks and is responsible for controlling the right side of the body.
On the other hand, the right hemisphere is focused on creativity and coordinates the left side of the body.

Hemisphere is a simple but not an easy game in which you control two rings by both hands.
That way you will use both sides of the brain and keep them in balance.

Sounds easy?
Let's try!
